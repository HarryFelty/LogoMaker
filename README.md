# LogoMaker

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the use of unit tests, writing to SVG files, and the use of inquirer. This project was also designed to provide a quick and simple solution to creating SVG files with various shapes and text. During this challenge, I learned about and gained more experience with using inquirer, writing unit tests, and writing to SVG files. I also gained experience working with classes across multiple JS files.
